# Jenkins-Basics

# What is Jenkins?

  Jenkins plays a crucial role in DevOps practices. Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It helps automate    parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying applications.

# What is Continuous Integration?

  Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. The primary goal of CI is to detect and         address issues early in the development process, which can lead to higher quality software and more efficient workflows.

# What is Continuous Delivery?

  Continuous Delivery is an extension of Continuous Integration that ensures that code changes are automatically prepared for release to production. With Continuous Delivery, the code is   always in a deployable state, and deploying to production is a manual process.

# What is Continuous Deployment?

  Continuous Deployment takes Continuous Delivery a step further by automating the release process so that every change that passes the CI pipeline is automatically deployed to             production without manual intervention.

# Summary
  CI/CD is essential for modern software development, allowing teams to deliver code more quickly, with higher quality, and with greater confidence.
  Continuous Integration (CI): Focuses on integrating code frequently and testing it automatically.
  Continuous Delivery (CD):    Ensures that the code is always in a deployable state, ready to be released.
  Continuous Deployment (CD):  Automates the deployment to production, making every change immediately available to users.

# How to Start working with Jenkins:

  # What is your Technology? 
    Java, Dotnet, Node, Python, Ruby.
 
  # Where is the code? 
    Git, SVN, Tfs

  # What is the Repo location and access?
    Get the repo location and make sure you have access to it.
 
  # What are your builders?
    Maven    -> Pom.xml           -> Goals ->Compile  -> Test -> Package -> Install -> Deploy -> Clean
    Ant      -> build.xml         -> Target
    Gradle   -> gradle.build      -> Tasks
    MSbuild  -> default.msbuild   -> Target.
  
  # How frequently do you want this job to be triggered?
    Daily or Weekly or Hourly 
 
  # How do you want feedback on this Job?
    Email →  Plugins → Email extension Plugins or Mailer Plugins
    Chat → Plugins →  Jabbar, Cisco comm, Slack, Skype Enterprise
